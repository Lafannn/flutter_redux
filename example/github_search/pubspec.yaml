flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section here, in
  # this "flutter" section, as in:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/montserrat/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/montserrat/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
    - family: Hind
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/hind/Hind-Regular.ttf
